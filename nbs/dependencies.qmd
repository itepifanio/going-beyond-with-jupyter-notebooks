### Dependency Hell

- When a software grows more libs tend to be added
- Packages are awesome it can add features, avoid/fix errors and provide more security to a software
- But keeping packages updates can be tricky
- Ex. Dependency 1 expects Python 3.7 usage and Dependency 2 expects Python 3.9

## Specify your dependencies

- ~= to specify releases
- == to fix a version
- != to exclude a version
- <=, >= to inclusively specify a range of versions
- <, > to specify a range of versions
