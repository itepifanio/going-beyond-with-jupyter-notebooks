# Going beyond with Jupyter notebooks

## Why using Jupyter notebooks to publish packages

Jupyter notebook is a tool that combines text and code on the same file,
this concept is called “literate programming” and it’s considered a
programming paradigm focused on humans.

> Jupyter notebook allows programmers to tell a story with their code

Although being a very well-regarded concept discussed by respected
researchers like [Donald
Knuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth), literate programming
tools like Jupyter notebooks are considered inefficient for serious
software development. This perception has limited Jupyter notebooks to
simple python scripts and educational materials.

The [Nbdev](http://nbdev.fast.ai/) library has proven that literate
programming is useful in developing big and serious projects, like
[FastAi](https://github.com/fastai/fastai). This tutorial will show
attendees how to get the benefits of literate programming while also
following software development best practices. We’ll get an hands-on
experience in writing and publishing a Python Package while using
Jupyter Notebooks. In addition to publishing the package, we’ll also
learn how to deploy the docs, run simple tests and run them on CI/CD,
making sure that our package will only get published if the tests pass.

## Which package will be developed?

A [French
Deck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French-suited_playing_cards), one of
the most common decks in games, that contains 52 cards split between 4
suits.

The package will be used to develop a simple
[blackjack](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack) as a proof of
concept.

## Authoring

[Ítalo Epifânio](linktr.ee/itepifanio) is a RnD Python Developer that
has been working for the last couple years developing and publishing
[packages](https://github.com/palaimon/ipyannotator) using nbdev.

## Presentation

The tutorial presentation is available at the `presentation` folder. Run
the presentation by using `quarto preview presentation/index.qmd`

You can install quarto from the [official
website](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) or using nbdev CLI by
running `nbdev_install_quarto`

## Getting started

We recommend to create a virtual environment to install the dependencies
required to create the presentation and run the included notebooks

- `python -m venv venv`
- `source venv/bin/activate`
- `pip install -e .[dev]` or
  `pip install nbdev jupyterlab matplotlib black ipytest ipywidgets`
